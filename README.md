# Asynchronous_Fifo

## Reviewed Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) and metastability concepts for designing an asynchronous FIFO in Verilog.
## Implemented 2FF synchronizers to resolve metastability issues in CDC. Used Gray code encoding to prevent multi-bit signal
transitions. Verified the final design with a testbench and simulation in ModelSim.
